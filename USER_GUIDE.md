## Introduction

Welcome to the Gate Entry System! This system helps you record all material movements in and out of the facility. As a Security Guard, your role is to:

- Create gate passes when materials arrive or leave
- Verify vehicle and driver information
- Record accurate quantities of materials
- Ensure compliance documents are in place before allowing material to leave
- Report any discrepancies or issues with materials

This guide will walk you through all the tasks you need to perform using the system.

## Understanding Gate Passes

### What is a Gate Pass?

A Gate Pass is a document that records material movement at the gate. Every time material enters or exits the facility, you need to create a Gate Pass.

### Types of Gate Passes

**Gate In** - Used when material is entering the facility:
- Materials arriving from suppliers (Purchase Orders)
- Materials from subcontractors (Subcontracting Orders)
- Materials returning from external locations (Stock Entries)

**Gate Out** - Used when material is leaving the facility:
- Materials being dispatched to customers (Sales Invoices, Delivery Notes)
- Materials being sent to subcontractors (Stock Entries)
- Materials being transferred to other locations (Stock Entries)

### Gate Pass Status

A Gate Pass goes through different stages:

- **Draft** - You are still entering information
- **Submitted** - The gate pass is complete and recorded
- **Receipt Created** - The material has been processed in the warehouse
- **Cancelled** - The gate pass was cancelled (material did not arrive/leave)

   - **Critical**: If the invoice value is above the threshold set by your company, you MUST see:
     - E-Invoice: Generated (for Sales Invoices)
     - E-Way Bill: Generated
   - If these are not generated, you will NOT be able to submit the gate pass

7. **Submit the Gate Pass**
   - If compliance documents are missing, the system will show an error
   - Contact the person who created the Sales Invoice to generate the required documents
   - Once compliance documents are generated, you can submit the gate pass

## Handling Material Returns

### Understanding Returns

Sometimes material that was sent out needs to come back. This could be:
- Material sent to a subcontractor that is being returned
- Material transferred to another location that is coming back
- Rejected material from a customer

### Creating a Return Gate Pass

1. **Select "Stock Entry" as Document Reference**

- Material quantity doesn't match what was expected

### How to Record Discrepancies

1. **Open the Gate Pass** (can be draft or submitted)

2. **Go to the Discrepancy Details Section**

3. **Check "Has Discrepancy"**
   - This will enable the discrepancy fields

4. **Enter Lost Quantity**
   - Enter the quantity of material that was lost
   - This should be in the same unit as the material

5. **Enter Damaged Quantity**
   - Enter the quantity of material that arrived damaged
   - This should be in the same unit as the material

6. **Add Notes**
   - In "Discrepancy Notes", describe what happened
   - Include details like:
     - When the discrepancy was noticed
     - Condition of the material
     - Any actions taken

7. **Save or Submit**
   - The discrepancy information will be recorded
   - **Important**: Lost and damaged quantities cannot exceed the total material quantity

## Understanding Compliance Requirements

### What is Compliance?

Compliance means following legal requirements. For material leaving the facility, certain documents must be generated before the material can be dispatched.

### E-Invoice

- **What it is**: An electronic invoice required by tax authorities
- **When required**: For Sales Invoices above a certain value (threshold set by your company)
- **Where to check**: In the Compliance Details section of the Gate Pass
- **Status options**:
  - Generated: Document is ready, you can proceed
  - Not Generated: Document is missing, you cannot submit
  - Not Required: Value is below threshold, no action needed

### E-Way Bill

- **What it is**: An electronic waybill required for transporting goods
- **When required**: For dispatches above a certain value (threshold set by your company)
- **Where to check**: In the Compliance Details section
- **Status options**:
  - Generated: Document is ready, you can proceed
  - Not Generated: Document is missing, you cannot submit
  - Not Required: Value is below threshold, no action needed

### What to Do When Compliance Documents are Missing

1. **Do NOT submit the gate pass** - The system will not allow it

2. **Check the compliance status section**
   - It will clearly show which documents are missing

3. **Contact the person who created the reference document**
   - For Sales Invoices: Contact the sales team
   - For Delivery Notes: Contact the dispatch team
   - They need to generate the required documents

4. **Wait for documents to be generated**
   - Once generated, refresh the gate pass
   - The compliance status will update automatically

5. **Then submit the gate pass**

### Important Compliance Rules

- **You cannot override compliance requirements** - The system will block submission
- **Compliance is checked automatically** - You don't need to calculate thresholds
- **Always check compliance before allowing material to leave** - This is a legal requirement

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Cannot find the Purchase Order in the list

**Possible causes**:
- The Purchase Order is not submitted
- The Purchase Order is closed
- You don't have permission to view it

**Solutions**:
- Ask the purchase department to submit the Purchase Order
- If the order is closed, contact your supervisor
- Contact system administrator if permission issues persist

### Problem: "Add Item" button doesn't appear

**Possible causes**:
- Reference Number is not selected
- Document Reference is not selected
- You're working on a Gate Out pass (items are auto-loaded for outbound passes)

**Solutions**:
- First select Document Reference (Purchase Order, Subcontracting Order, etc.)
- Then select Reference Number
- The "Add Item" button should appear in the Items List section
- For Gate Out passes, items are automatically loaded - you don't need to add them

### Problem: Cannot enter received quantity

**Possible causes**:
- Items haven't been added yet
- The field is read-only (for outbound passes or submitted gate passes)

**Solutions**:
- Click "Add Item" button first to select and add items
- For outbound passes (Sales Invoice, Delivery Note), quantities are automatically set and locked - you cannot change them
- If the gate pass is already submitted, you cannot edit quantities

### Problem: Cannot submit gate pass - compliance error

**Possible causes**:
- E-Invoice not generated (for Sales Invoices above threshold)
- E-Way Bill not generated (for dispatches above threshold)

**Solutions**:
- Check the Compliance Details section to see what's missing
- Contact the person who created the Sales Invoice/Delivery Note
- Ask them to generate the required documents
- Wait for documents to be generated, then try again

### Problem: Vehicle number field is empty but required

**Possible causes**:
- Sales Invoice/Delivery Note doesn't have vehicle information
- Stock Entry doesn't have vehicle information

**Solutions**:
- Enter the vehicle number manually
- Check the vehicle physically at the gate
- Enter the correct registration number

### Problem: No items appear in the Add Item dialog

**Possible causes**:
- Purchase Order/Subcontracting Order has no items
- All items have already been received (pending quantity is 0)
- All items from the reference document have already been added to this gate pass
- There's a system error

**Solutions**:
- Verify the reference document has items
- Check if all items are already received (pending quantity is 0)
- If you've already added some items, the dialog will only show items that haven't been added yet
- Contact system administrator if issue persists

### Problem: Cannot see the gate pass I just created

**Possible causes**:
- It's saved as draft and you're looking in the wrong list
- You don't have permission to view it
- It was created for a different company

**Solutions**:
- Check "Draft" gate passes in the list
- Use filters to search by date or reference number
- Contact supervisor if permission issues

### Problem: Discrepancy fields are disabled

**Possible causes**:
- "Has Discrepancy" checkbox is not checked

**Solutions**:
- Check the "Has Discrepancy" checkbox first
- Then you can enter lost and damaged quantities

### Problem: System shows error when entering quantities

**Possible causes**:
- Quantity exceeds ordered quantity
- Quantity is negative
- Invalid number format

**Solutions**:
- Enter quantity less than or equal to ordered quantity
- Enter positive numbers only
- Use decimal numbers if needed (e.g., 10.5)

## Important Reminders

1. **Always verify vehicle and driver information** - This is critical for security and tracking

2. **Check compliance documents for outbound material** - Never allow material to leave without required documents

3. **Enter accurate quantities** - Match what you physically see, not what the document says

4. **Record discrepancies immediately** - Don't wait, document issues as soon as you notice them

5. **Submit gate passes promptly** - Don't leave them in draft status for too long

6. **Contact the right person for issues**:
   - Purchase Orders: Purchase department
   - Sales Invoices: Sales/dispatch team
   - System errors: System administrator
   - Compliance documents: Person who created the reference document

7. **Keep the gate pass number** - You may need to reference it later

8. **Double-check before submitting** - Once submitted, changes require cancellation and recreation
